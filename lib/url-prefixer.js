/**
 * This file creates a node.js Stream that re-writes chunks of HTML on-the-fly so that all
 * non-relative URLS are prefixed with the given string.
 *
 * For example, If you set the config.prefix to '/proxy/' and pass in this chunk of html:
 *   <a href="http://example.com/">link to example.com</a>
 * It would output this:
 *   <a href="/proxy/http://example.com/">link to example.com</a>
 *
 * It buffers a small amount of text from the end of each chunk to ensure that it properly
 * handles links that are split between two chunks (packets).
